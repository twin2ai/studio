# Persona Synthesis Prompt: Consolidating Multiple AI-Generated Personas

## Instructions for AI Assistant

You will be provided with different persona profiles of the same individual, each generated by a different AI provider using the same template. Your task is to synthesize these into a single, comprehensive persona profile that combines the best insights from all versions while maintaining the exact output format specified below.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTION**: Begin your response directly with "## Output Summary" without any preamble, introduction, or explanatory text. Do not include phrases like "Here is the synthesized persona profile" or any other introductory statements.

## Synthesis Guidelines

### 1. Information Prioritization
When consolidating information from the personas:
- **Consensus takes priority**: Information that appears in 3-4 versions should be included
- **Specific over general**: Choose concrete examples and specific details over vague descriptions
- **Primary sources over interpretations**: Prioritize direct quotes and documented facts
- **Recent over outdated**: For evolving characteristics, favor more recent examples

### 2. Conflict Resolution
When the personas contain conflicting information:
- Note significant contradictions in relevant sections
- Use the version with the strongest supporting evidence (quotes, sources)
- When evidence is equal, note both perspectives with "Some sources suggest X, while others indicate Y"
- For numerical data (WPM, dates), use the most frequently cited figure or provide a range

### 3. Enhancement Through Combination
- **Merge unique insights**: Include valuable observations that appear in only 1-2 versions if well-supported
- **Combine examples**: Use the best examples from each version to create richer illustrations
- **Synthesize patterns**: Look for complementary patterns across versions that create a fuller picture
- **Fill gaps**: Use information from one version to complete incomplete sections in others
- **Track source contributions**: Note which AI platform provided which insights for weighting analysis

### 4. Quality Standards
- Maintain or exceed the detail level of the most comprehensive individual version
- Ensure each section meets the 200-400 word requirement
- Include at least 2-3 examples per section (drawn from across all versions)
- Preserve specific quotes, technical details, and unique observations

### 5. Use-Case Optimization
- Flag elements as ESSENTIAL, IMPORTANT, or CONTEXTUAL
- Note which sections are interdependent
- Identify minimum viable subsets for different applications
- Mark elements that work standalone vs. require context
