# Persona Synthesis with Feedback: Regenerating with User Input

## Instructions for AI Assistant

You will be provided with different persona profiles of the same individual, each regenerated by different AI providers after incorporating user feedback. Your task is to synthesize these into a single, comprehensive persona profile that addresses the feedback while combining the best insights from all versions.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTION**: Begin your response directly with "## Output Summary" without any preamble, introduction, or explanatory text.

## Feedback Context

The following feedback was provided by users and should be specifically addressed in the synthesis:

{{FEEDBACK}}

## Synthesis Guidelines

### 1. Feedback Priority
- **Address all feedback points**: Ensure each piece of feedback is reflected in the final synthesis
- **Show improvement**: The synthesis should clearly demonstrate how feedback was incorporated
- **Maintain quality**: Don't sacrifice overall quality while addressing feedback

### 2. Information Prioritization
When consolidating information from the personas:
- **Consensus takes priority**: Information that appears in 3-4 versions should be included
- **Specific over general**: Choose concrete examples and specific details over vague descriptions
- **Primary sources over interpretations**: Prioritize direct quotes and documented facts
- **Recent over outdated**: For evolving characteristics, favor more recent examples

### 3. Conflict Resolution
When the personas contain conflicting information:
- Note significant contradictions in relevant sections
- Use the version with the strongest supporting evidence (quotes, sources)
- When evidence is equal, note both perspectives with "Some sources suggest X, while others indicate Y"
- For numerical data (WPM, dates), use the most frequently cited figure or provide a range

### 4. Enhancement Through Combination
- **Merge unique insights**: Include valuable observations that appear in only 1-2 versions if well-supported
- **Combine examples**: Use the best examples from each version to create richer illustrations
- **Synthesize patterns**: Look for complementary patterns across versions that create a fuller picture
- **Fill gaps**: Use information from one version to complete incomplete sections in others

### 5. Quality Standards
- Maintain or exceed the detail level of the most comprehensive individual version
- Ensure each section meets word requirements
- Include at least 2-3 examples per section (drawn from across all versions)
- Preserve specific quotes, technical details, and unique observations

**START DIRECTLY WITH THE CONTENT BELOW - NO INTRODUCTORY TEXT**

[The rest of the format follows the same structure as the original persona_combination.txt...]

## Feedback Integration Note

At the end of your synthesis, include a brief section titled "### Feedback Addressed" that explicitly lists how each piece of user feedback was incorporated into the final synthesis.

## Input Location

The regenerated persona profiles appear below, each wrapped in delimiter markers (<<< and >>>). Parse each persona profile and synthesize them according to the instructions above, ensuring all feedback points are addressed.
