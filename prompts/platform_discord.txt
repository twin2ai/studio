You are tasked with creating a Discord Bot prompt based on a comprehensive persona. The goal is to transform the detailed persona into a bot personality that works effectively in Discord's casual, community-focused environment with its specific constraints and social dynamics.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTION**: Begin your response directly without any preamble, introduction, or explanatory text.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not mention the persona's name anywhere in the condensed version. The output should describe the characteristics, traits, and behaviors without revealing the identity of the individual being portrayed.
